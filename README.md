## Project Overview:

AtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer, is experiencing customer churn due to suspected service issues related to order delivery.  Before expanding operations, they need to address these issues and establish a reliable system for monitoring delivery performance. This project aims to develop a system for tracking "On Time" and "In Full" delivery service levels to ensure customer satisfaction and support future growth.  The project will involve daily monitoring of key metrics and provide insights to enable swift responses to service disruptions.

## Problem Statement:

Several key customers have recently terminated their contracts with AtliQ Mart, likely due to inconsistent and unreliable delivery service.  Products were reportedly not delivered on time or in full, leading to customer dissatisfaction.  This issue needs to be resolved before AtliQ Mart expands to new markets to avoid replicating the same problems and jeopardizing their growth strategy.  The current lack of a robust tracking system makes it difficult to pinpoint the root causes of these delivery failures and implement effective solutions.

## Project Goal:

To develop and implement a system for daily tracking and reporting of On-Time (OT), In-Full (IF), and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery performance for all customers.  This will enable AtliQ Mart to identify and address service issues promptly, improve customer satisfaction, and prevent further contract losses.  Ultimately, this improved delivery performance will support the company's planned expansion.

## Key Metrices:
 **1.** OT (On-Time Delivery): The percentage of customer orders delivered on or before the scheduled delivery date. Calculated as: (Number of on-time orders / Total number of orders) * 100

 **2.** IF (In-Full Deliver): The percentage of customer orders delivered with all items and quantities as specified in the order. Calculated as: (Number of orders delivered in full / Total number of orders) * 100

 **3.** OTIF (On-Time In-Full): The percentage of customer orders delivered both on time and in full. Calculated as: (Number of orders delivered on time and in full / Total number of orders) * 100. This metric represents the most stringent measure of delivery performance.

 **4.** LIFR (Line Fill Rate ): The percentage of order lines (individual items within an order) fulfilled. Calculated as: (Number of order lines fulfilled / Total number of order lines across all orders) * 100. This metric helps understand if specific products are consistently causing issues.

 **5.** VOFR (Volume Fill Rate): The percentage of the total order volume (e.g., in units, weight, or cubic meters) fulfilled. Calculated as: (Volume of goods shipped / Total order volume) * 100. This metric is important for understanding if the quantity of goods ordered is being delivered correctly.
